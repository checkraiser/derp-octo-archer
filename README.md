#derp-octo-archer

A github issues viewer written with angularjs.

This project is very much a hack-in-progress.  Please feel free to help make it better!


##Installation

* clone the repository to a folder.
* "npm install" to get the node bits.
* edit the config.js with your settings.  (To get a github api key, go to your github account settings > applications)
